	<h2> Ed Sheeran</h2>
	<p class="one">I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were 
The someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, 
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p> <br>
	<p class="two">Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening 
To our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, 
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, 
You look perfect tonight</p>
	<p class="three"> Well I found a woman, 
Stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope 
That someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more 
Than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children 
Of our own
	</p>
